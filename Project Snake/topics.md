## About The Project

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started
Install pygame on whatever platform you're using to work on the project.
Repl is okay, but keep in mind that Repl kind of sucks for Pygame. I'd
strongly encourage moving to an offline IDE like PyCharm for this one.

For Repl, use the package manager to search for Pygame and install it in the project.
For PyCharm, just hover the pygame import statement and it'll offer you a "Quick Fix" to install the package.

### Prerequisites & Concepts to know

 - Data Types
 - Variables
 - Conditional Statements
 - While Loops
 - For Loops
 - Lists
 - 2D Lists
 - Tuples
 - Array Functions (Append, Insert)
 - Functions
 - Return Statements
 - Classes
 - Constructors
 - Pygame basics
 - Pygame events
 - Pygame timers (using get_ticks())
 - Basic modular arithmetic (for direction conditions; can be replaced with if-else if necessary)

### Installation
To run the program, simply run the command `python main.py`


## Bugs
Bugs: None
